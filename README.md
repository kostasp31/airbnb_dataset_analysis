# airbnb_dataset_analysis
In this assignment, my colleague and I were tasked with analyzing a large dataset of Airbnb reservations. In the first part of the project, we performed data cleaning and exploration, followed by an analysis to answer specific questions based on the insights we extracted from the data. We then implemented a recommendation system for users of the platform.

In the second part, we focused on the user reviews section of the dataset. We annotated the reviews using models from Hugging Face and conducted sentiment analysis by creating training and test datasets to train our model. We extracted features using TF-IDF and word embeddings.

We compared the results of our analysis using Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), drawing conclusions based on the performance of each model. Finally, we examined the similarity between neighborhoods using appropriate metrics, including Jaccard and cosine similarity.

The Github repository below contains the jupiter notebooks created for this project.
